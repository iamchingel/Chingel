This app is designed to help you find restaurants in a specified location. Start by creating an account with us. You can signup using email or use Facebook. After you have created an account, you will be prompted to select a default location which will be saved for your account. You can change your default location later on, after you have logged in.

Once you have successfully logged in, a list of 20 restaurants will be loaded initially for the location you selected earlier. The restaurants will be sorted from descending to ascending in terms or average rating. You can change the sorting by tapping on the "Rating High to Low" and then tapping on the search button.

You can change your current location, by tapping on the location address in the navigation bar. After you have selected the location, you will be brought back to the initial view, and new restaurants will be displayed.

Tap on a restaurant to be segued into the details of the Restaurant. Here, you can find the details of the restaurant and even book an Uber right from the app. Else, you can get the directions to the restaurant.( To be able to get directions from the app, you need to have Google Maps installed.).

You can favorite a restaurant by tapping on the heart button in the detail view of the restaurant. Tapping on a previously favorited restaurant will remove it from your favorites. To access all your favorite restaurants, go back to home screen and tap on the menu button on the top left of your navigation bar.
